# Instructions for Submission

- This homework consists of two parts: Computing Exercises, and Theory Exercises. 
- The submission portal on Canvas has 3 questions:
    - One for uploading your `.html` file for the Computing Exercises
    - One for uploading your `.zip` file containing both the `.html` and `.Rmd` files (along with any relevant datasets/images) for the Computing Exercises
    - One for uploading a `.PDF` of a photo or scan of your handwritten work for the Theory Exercises
- Remember to **rename** your `.Rmd` file as `Homework06_yournetid.Rmd`
- Remember to always copy the necessary files to your `workingfiles` folder; never edit and/or knit the files directly in the `10-content` folder.

# Computing Exercises:

## Exercise 1: Glossary of Functions

Fill in the following table with the functions you learned in Lecture 09 and 10 this week. Add as many lines as you feel are necessary (remember that Worksheet 0 covered how to add rows to tables in Markdown).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


| *`R` Function* | *Description of Function* | *Example of the Function* |
|------|-------|-------|
| `Function Name` | Function Description | `Function Example` |

## Exercise 2: Constructing and Plotting P.M.F.'s from Observed Data

The number of times the audio system in IV Theatre 1 failed was observed over a period of 1 year. It was found that 

- 0 failures occurred in each of 8 weeks
- 1 failure occurred in each of 14 weeks
- 2 failures occurred in each of 11 weeks
- 3 failures occurred in each of 10 weeks
- 4 failures occurred in each of 5 weeks
- 5 failures occurred in each of 3 weeks
- 6 failures occurred in 1 week

\

**(a)** Use this observed data to estimate the probability distribution of the audio system failures in a week. You can use the `round` function to make the probabilities round to 2 decimals. Check that it is a valid probability distribution 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Plot this distribution. Use the plot function with the `type = "h"` option to draw a line at each failure number. Explain what the height of each line represents in this plot. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** Find the cumulative distribution function of the audio system failures in a week. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(d)** Plot the c.d.f using `type="s"` to get the stair-case plot. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(e)** Use your p.m.f and c.d.f and the plot from (d) to approximately calculate $\mathbb{P}(X \leq 3.5)$. Which was the easiest way to calculate this probability? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(f)**  Use your p.m.f and c.d.f and the plot from (d) to approximately calculate $\mathbb{P}(X \leq 1)$. Understand how the calculation for (e) differs from that of (f) while using the plot. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 3: Betting Odds

A magical genie approaches you one day, and makes you an offer to give you \$100 if you win a game. He offers you the choice to play one of the following two games:

- **Game A:** The genie tosses 100 fair coins; you win if more than 50 of the tosses land on heads.
- **Game B:** The genie tosses 1000 fair coins; you win if more than 500 of the tosses land on heads.

Which game should you play? In other words, in which of the two games are your chances of winning the \$100 higher? Be sure to justify your answer. \

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here, if applicable

```

**Replace this line with your final answer, and any other justifications you want to make.**

# Theory Exercises

## Exercise 4: Coin Flips

Consider flipping two coins and counting number of tails.  **Do these calculations by hand and show your work!; do not use `R` for these calculations!**

(a) Write down the p.m.f. 
(b) Compute the expected value $\mathbb{E}[X]$
(c) Compute the variance $\mathrm{Var}(X)$
(d) Find the cumulative distribution function of $X$.

## Exercise 5: Life Was Like a Box of Chocolates

In a box there are 24 pieces of candy. 18 of these candies have a milk chocolate coating, and 6 have a white chocolate coating. Two thirds of the milk chocolate
candies have a Marzipan filling. In total, there are 16 candies with Marzipan filling.

(a) Find the probability of randomly selecting a candy that is either coated in white chocolate or filled with Marzipan.

(b) Suppose you randomly selected a candy, opened it, and noted that is has a white chocolate coating. What is the probability that it has a marzipan filling?

## Exercise 6: Counting Cards

Two cards are drawn at random and without replacement from a standard deck of cards.

(a) What is the probability that the second card is an ace, given that the first card was an ace?
(b) What is the probability that both cards are aces?
