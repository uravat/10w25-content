# Instructions for Submission

- This homework consists of two parts: Computing Exercises, and Theory Exercises. 
- The submission portal on Canvas has 3 questions:
    - One for uploading your `.html` file for the Computing Exercises
    - One for uploading your `.zip` file containing both the `.html` and `.Rmd` files (along with any relevant datasets/images) for the Computing Exercises
    - One for uploading a `.PDF` of a photo or scan of your handwritten work for the Theory Exercises
- Remember to **rename** your `.Rmd` file as `Homework05_yournetid.Rmd`
- Remember to always copy the necessary files to your `workingfiles` folder; never edit and/or knit the files directly in the `10-content` folder.

# Computing Exercises:

## Exercise 1: Glossary of Functions

Fill in the following table with the functions you learned in Lecture 07 and 08 this week. Add as many lines as you feel are necessary (remember that Worksheet 0 covered how to add rows to tables in Markdown).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


| *`R` Function* | *Description of Function* | *Example of the Function* |
|------|-------|-------|
| `sample` | takes a random sample of specified size from the elements of our data using either with or without replacement | `sample(c("H", "T"), 10, replace = TRUE))` |

## Exercise 2: Simulation

In this problem, we will explore the following question: In 9 rolls of a fair six-sided die, what is the probability that the sum of the rolls equals 22? Specifically, we shall work toward answering this through simulation, using $10,000$ replications. \

**(a)** **Answer the question using a `for` loop.** Specifically: use only one call to the `sample()` function to simulate all 9 dice rolls, and use a `for` loop to generate each of the $10,000$ replications. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(b)** **Now, Rewrite your code in two or fewer lines.** Specifically:

1. use the `replicate()` function to replace the `for` loop. 
2. use the `mean()` function with appropriate logical expression(s) to calculate the required probability. 

**Here is the key and useful idea in calculating probability using simulations:** For each replication, create a logical vector which is  `TRUE` if the event of interest occurs and `FALSE` if the event does not occur. Then take the mean of this vector. This estimates the probability of the event. _Make sure you understand why this works. Come to ULA/TA/instructor office hours if you aren't sure._

To get stared with this exercise **think through this:** What is the event you are interested in focusing on? Can you write that event as a logical (T/F) expression? If so, what do you need to feed into the logical expression regarding your dice rolls? The answer to these questions helps you figure out what expression to feed into the `replicate` function. _As I mentioned, in simulation, you tend to work backwards and in handwritten problems you tend to work forwards to solve the problem._

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(c)** Are your answers to part (a) and (b) the same? Why or why not? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answer.**

\

**(d)** Roll three fair six-sided dice. What's the probability that the minimum of the scores is greater than 2?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 3: Doubling-Down

In a past iteration of PSTAT 10, the student demographics of the class (specifically which major/s students were enrolled in) was recorded. The data has been stored in the file `roster.csv`. The dataset contains three columns:

  * `id`: the student's ID number (anonymized)
  * `major1`: the student's first major
  * `major2`: the students second (double) major; `NA` if the student is enrolled in only one major. 

\

**(a)** Load the data into your `.Rmd` file. **Hint:** `read.csv()`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(b)** Write code to determine the number of students included in the dataset; do **NOT** just view the data and manually count!

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** What is the probability that a randomly selected student has Economics as their `major1`?. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(d)** What is the probability that a randomly selected student is a double-major? **Hint:** Think carefully about how double-major-ness is encoded in the dataset. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 4: Random questions!

The questions in this exercise are not related to one another as in previous exercises. They are shorter questions and are strung together randomly. 

**(a)** Simulate 20 rolls of a fair 8-sided die. Result should be a vector of 20 numbers indicating the value of each die roll.

`r bfcolor("Solution:", "blue")`

Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to use the `sample()` function:

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\bigskip

---

**(b)** Using the `mtcars` dataset, sample 5 mpg values. Result should be a vector of 5 numbers.

`r bfcolor("Solution:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\bigskip

---


**(c)** Randomly sample and print 6 rows from mtcars dataframe.

`r bfcolor("Solution:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\bigskip

---


**(d)** There are 3 red, 3 blue and 4 green balls in a bag. Using `sample()`, simulate drawing two balls from the bag, without replacement. Print the colors of the drawn balls.

`r bfcolor("Solution:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

# Theory Exercises:

## Exercise 5: Basic Probabilities

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events such that $\Prob(A) = 0.2$, $\Prob(B) = 0.3$, and $\Prob(A \cap B) = 0.1$. 

(a) Compute $\Prob(A \cup B)$
(b) Compute $\Prob(A^\complement \cap B^\complement)$. **Hint:** Drawing a Venn diagram may be useful here.
(c) Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Why or why not?
(d) Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive? Why or why not?

## Exercise 6: Picking a Number

A number is picked at random from the set $\{1, 2, \cdots, 100\}$.

(a) What is the probability that it is a multiple of 3?
(b) What is the probability that it is greater than 50?
(c) What is the probability that it is a multiple of 3 that is strictly greater than 50?
(d) What is the probability that it is a multiple of 3, **given** that it is strictly greater than 50?

## Exercise 7: Netflix

A recent _Netflix_ survey sureyed several individuals about whether they prefer TV Shows, Movies, or have no strong prefernece either way. The age bracket of each individual was also recorded; the results of the survey are displayed below.


| | Prefer TV Shows | Prefer Movies | No Preference |
|---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| **< 15** | 10 | 15 | 10 |
| **15 - 25** | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **26 - 35** | 30 | 15 | 10 |
| **36 +** | 10 | 15 | 5 |

If a person is selected at random from the pool surveyed individuals, what is the probability that...

(a) ... they prefer TV Shows, **and** are between 15 and 25 years old?
(b) ... they prefer TV Shows?
(c) ... they are over 36 years old?
(d) ... they prefer movies, **given** that they are between 26 and 35 years old?

## Exercise 8: Lost Airpods

Sally has lost her airpods somewhere in her apartment. Based on her activity over the past few days, she has the following beliefs:

- She is 25\% certain they are in her living room
- She is 40\% certain they are in her bedroom
- She is 30\% certain they are in the bathroom
- She is 5\% certain they are not in her apartment at all.

Based on how messy each room of her apartment is, she also believes:

- A search of her living room has a 60\% chance of successfully locating her airpods
- A search of her bedroom has a 80\% chance of successfully locating her airpods
- A search of her bathroom has a 30\% chance of successfully locating her airpods
- A search of any location outside her apartment has a 10\% chance of successfully locating her airpods

Use this information to answer the following questions:

(a) What is the probability that she searches her living room **and** is successful at locating her airpods?

(b) What is the probability that she searches her bedroom **and** is successful at locating her airpods?

(c) What is the probability that she is successful at locating her airpods?
