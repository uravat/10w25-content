# Instructions for Submission

- The submission portal on Canvas is back to having 2 questions:
    - One for uploading your `.html` file 
    - One for uploading your `.zip` file containing both the `.html` and `.Rmd` files (along with any relevant datasets/images) 
- The final exercise presents an **optional** opportunity for **extra credit**. You are not required to do this exercise. Please read and follow the instructions carefully to qualify for additional points, should you choose to pursue this option. 
- Remember to **rename** your `.Rmd` file as `Homework07_yournetid.Rmd`
- Remember to always copy the necessary files to your `workingfiles` folder; never edit and/or knit the files directly in the `10-content` folder.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Glossary of Functions

Fill in the following table with the functions you learned in Lecture 11 this week. Add as many lines as you feel are necessary (remember that Worksheet 0 covered how to add rows to tables in Markdown).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


| *`R` Function* | *Description of Function* | *Example of the Function* |
|------|-------|-------|
| `Function Name` | Function Description | `Function Example` |

## Exercise 2: Train Station

You’re at the train station, and you know that a train departs between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. The exact departure time follows a uniform distribution. Letting $U$ represent the exact departure time, we can model this as $U \sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$. In other words, $U$, the departure time is uniformly distributed between 0 hours and 1 hour.

\

**(a)** Calculate the probability that the train departs before 8:30 AM, that is $\mathbb{P}(U < 1/2)$? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Say you arrive right on time at 8:00 AM. Calculate the probability that you’ll have to wait at the station for more than 15 minutes (i.e., the train departs
after 8:15 AM).

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\


**(c)** If you want to catch the train with at least a 90% chance of success, what is the latest time you can arrive at the train station? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

## Exercise 3: Sleep Study

A recent study at \emph{Gaucho University} surveyed several undergraduate students on their sleep habits. The results are stored in the dataset `sleep.csv`, which contains the following variables:

- `age`: the age of each individual
- `standing`: the standing (`Freshman`, `Sophomore`, `Junior`, `Senior`, `SuperSenior`) of each individual
- `sleep`: the amount of sleep (in hours) each individual had on average, per night
- `gender`: the gender of each student (`female`, `male`, `nonbinary`)
- `coffee`: the average number of cups of coffee each individual drinks, per day

\

**(a)** Read in the data.

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Are there any missing values? If so, which variable(s) contain missing values?

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

\

**(c)** Generate an appropriate plot to visualize the distribution of ages represented in this study. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(d)** Generate an appropriate plot to visualize the distribution of average daily coffee consumption. (Hint: note that the variable `coffee` contains only integer values.)

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(e)** Generate an appropriate plot to visualize the distribution of genders present in this study.

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(f)** Generate a plot to visualize the relationship between `sleep` and `standing`. Does any particular standing appear to get less sleep (on average) than other standings?

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**


\

**(g)** Plot the relationship between `sleep` (on the y-axis) and `age` (on the x-axis).

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```



\

**(h)** Provide a numerical summary of the average amount of sleep of participants in the study. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(i)** Test the normality of the values in the `sleep` variable. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 4: Dice to Meet You

**(a)** Consider the experiment of rolling 2 fair six-sided dice, and recording the sum. Simulate conducting this experiment 10,000 times and plot the histogram of the sum. Does the sum appear to be normally distributed? Use a QQplot to verify.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

\


**(b)** Now, consider the experiment of rolling 4 fair six-sided dice, and recording the sum. Simulate conducting this experiment 10,000 times and plot the histogram of the sum. Does the sum appear to be normally distributed? Use a QQplot to verify.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

\


**(c)** Now, consider the experiment of rolling 6 fair six-sided dice, and recording the sum. Simulate conducting this experiment 10,000 times and plot the histogram of the sum. Does the sum appear to be normally distributed? Use a QQplot to verify.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**


\

**(d)** Now, consider the experiment of rolling 10 fair six-sided dice, and recording the sum. Simulate conducting this experiment 10,000 times and plot the histogram of the sum. Does the sum appear to be normally distributed? Use a QQplot to verify.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

\

**(e)** Finally, collect the QQPlots you made in parts (a) through (d) above and display them in a 2 $\times$ 2 grid, using the `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` command from Lecture 9. Comment on how the normality of the sum changes as a function of the number of dice that were rolled.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your final answer.**

## Exercise 5: Phone a Friend

The amount of time a randomly selected person spends on the phone in a given day is normally distributed with mean 8hrs and a standard deviation 1.5hrs. \

**(a)** What is the probability that a randomly selected person will spend between 8 and 10 hours on their phone in a given day?

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`


```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** What amount of time is at the 63^rd^ percentile of time spent on the phone in a given day?

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** Now, a sample of 123 people is taken with replacement. What is the probability that exactly 36 of them spend between 8 and 10 hours on their phone in a given day? **Hint:** You'll need to use your answer from part (a).

`r bfcolor("Solutions", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```
