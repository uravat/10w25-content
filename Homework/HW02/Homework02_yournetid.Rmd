# Instructions

- Remember to always copy the necessary files to your `workingfiles` folder; never edit and/or knit the files directly in the `10-content` folder.

- Rename your `.Rmd` file as `Homework02_your-netid.Rmd`. For example, my Rmd script file will be `Homework02_umaravat.Rmd`.

- Make sure to include your identifying details in the Rmd file.

- When submitting to Canvas, follow the provided submission instructions carefully.

# Exercises  


## Exercise 0: YAML


Update the YAML to reflect your own information (i.e. name, netid, etc.).

---

## Exercise 1: Lecture 2 Summary

### Part (a): DataTypes

Write down a bulleted list of the types of data `R` supports. Make sure your list displays properly in your final knitted document. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


\

Add other concepts and their summary here. 

### Part (b): Glossary of Functions

Fill in the following table with the functions you learned till Lecture 02. Add as many lines as you feel are necessary (remember that Worksheet 0 covered how to add rows to tables in Markdown).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


| *`R` Function* | *Description of Function* | *Example of the Function* |
|------|-------|-------|
| `c` | combines elements into a vector | `c(1, 2, "hello")` |

## Exercise 2: Splitting Hairs

In this problem, we'll deal with a new function that can help manage strings. Remember- HELP files are your friend! \

**(a)** Look up the `strsplit()` function in RStudio Help.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(b)** Write down code that takes the string "hair" and returns "h" "a" "i" "r".

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(c)** The function `extract_month()`, which has been partially written below, is designed to take in a date of the form MM/DD/YY (coded as a string), and extract out the month. For instance, `extract_month("09/30/05")` should return `"09"`. Copy the code into a new code chunk (below the `r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")` line) and complete the code to ensure the function works as expected.

```{r, eval = F}
extract_month <- function(x) {
  split_date <- <REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR CODE>
  return(split_date[[1]][1]) # DO NOT CHANGE THIS LINE
}
```

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(d)** Test your function with 3 different dates.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

## Exercise 3: Chunky Guacamole

In this problem, we'll get some more practice with basic `R` commands. For each part, you will need to insert a code chunk on the line right after the `r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")` line. Additionally, at least one of the parts below may result in a code chunk that contains an error; **that is fine!** Just make sure your final document still knits, even with that error (hint: what options can you pass into your code chunk to ensure that it knits, despite there being an error present? This was used in Lecture 1)

**(a)** Assign the value `6` to a variable called `guac`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(b)** Assign the value `2` to a variable called `a`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(c)** Assign the value `"delicious"` to a variable called `mole`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(d)** What should the code `guac + a` return? Confirm your answer by running the code in a code chunk.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(e)** What do you think `guac + a + mole` will return? _No coding required for this part_

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")` 


\

**(f)** Now, run the code `guac + a + mole` and comment on the result.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

## Exercise 4: Palmy Weather

The file `palm.csv` contains data on the prevalence of four different types of palm trees in the Santa Barbara Area. The four types of palm trees are encoded as:

- `MFP`: Mexican Fan Palm
- `KP`: King Palm
- `QP`: Queen Palm
- `FP`: Foxtail Palm

Each row of the data consists of the number of each type of palms in a certain city block; each block is coded with a unique identifying number, which is stored as `ID`. \

The following code chunk can be used to load in the dataset as a dataframe, assigned to the variable `palm`:
```{r}
palm <- read.csv("./data/palm.csv", header = T)

```

**(a)** How many city blocks were included in this study?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(b)** What is the average density of Queen Palms per City Block?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(c)** What is the median density of King Palms per City Block?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(d)** Which City Block contains the most Foxtail Palms?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


\

**(e)** Which city block contains the fewest Mexican Fan Palms? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

## Exercise 5: Score!

Suppose we have exam scores for 5 students: Brady, Angelica, Sandra, Michael, and Josh. Their scores are 17, 15, 19, 20, and 16, respectively.

**(a)** Create a vector of these scores.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(b)** Find the mean score in two ways (using `mean` and using `sum`).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`




\

**(c)** Find the median score.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`


\

**(d)** Assign the name of each student to their test score.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`




\

**(e)** Retrieve Angelica's score in two ways.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(f)** Retrieve Brady's and Sandra's score, in that order.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`



\

**(g)** Retrieve the scores of everyone except Josh.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`
