# Instructions for Completion

- We are back to having only computing exercises on the worksheets. As such, you must complete the computing exercises by filling in your code on this `.Rmd` file.

# Exercises

## Exercise 0: YAML

Update the YAML to reflect your own information (i.e. name, collaborators, etc.). If you did not collaborate with anyone, note that down in the YAML.

## Exercise 1: IQ

The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of a person is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 16. \

**(a)** What percentage of the population have an IQ in the interval (84, 116)?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** What percentage of the population have an IQ lower than 90?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** MENSA is an organization for people with an IQ in the top 2\% of the population. What is the lowest IQ score a person needs to posses in order to get admitted to MENSA?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 2: Plotting

Suppose $X \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 3)$. [Remember that this is another notation for specifying that $X$ follows a normal distribution.] \

**(a)** Define a function `dens_fnt()` that returns the density of $X$. You can use calls to `dnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc., but your function should be able to be called on a single input; e.g. `dens_fnt(10)`.  

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Define a function `cdf_2()` that returns the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of $X$.  You can use calls to `dnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc., but your function should be able to be called on a single input; e.g. `cdf_2(10)`. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** Generate a **side-by-side** plot of the density curve and c.d.f. of $X$. Ensure both of your plots have a lower $x-$limit of 1 and an upper $x-$limit of 19. (Can you tell me why I picked these two values?) **Some Hints:** 

- For generating the plots, the `curve()` function may be useful (along with the functions you created in parts (a) and (b) above).
- For getting your plots side-by-side, remember the `par` and `mfrow` commands from Lecture 9. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 3: Temperature in GauchoVille

A weather station collected 100 measurements (at randomly selected times throughout several days across several months) of the temperature (in Celsius) at the remote northern village of _GauchoVille_. The data is stored in the file `temp.csv`, along with an index indicating on what day each measurement was taken. \

**(a)** Read in the data. 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(b)** Plot a histogram of the temperature values. Based solely on this histogram, do you think the temperature in \emph{GauchoVille} follows a normal distribution?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your answers.**

\

**(c)** Generate a graphic that allows you to more rigorously test the assertion of normality. (As a starting point, you may want to read the Lecture 10 slides again, paying attention to how we assessed normality during lecture.)

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

**Replace this line with your answers.**


\

**(d)** Based on your answers above, do you think that histograms are a good way of determining normality? Why or why not?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answers.**

## Exercise 4: More Normal Stuff

Suppose the random variable $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $10$ and standard deviation $2$. 

**(a)** Approximately what is the value $\mathbb{P}(8 < X < 12)$? You should be able to answer this without any computation!

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answers.**


\

**(b)** Now, simulate 10000 draws from the $\mathcal{N}(10, 2)$ distribution and compute the proportion of observations that were in the interval $(8, 10)$. As a reminder, this number should be very close to your answer to part (a) above.


`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```
