# Instructions for Completion

- We are back to having only computing exercises on the worksheets. As such, you must complete the computing exercises by filling in your code on this `.Rmd` file.

\

# Exercises

## Exercise 0: YAML

Update the YAML to reflect your own information (i.e. name, collaborators, etc.). If you did not collaborate with anyone, note that down in the YAML.

For this worksheet, we need will again connect to the Chinook DB from lecture. Make sure the database is available to this `.Rmd` file in `data` folder

## Exercise 1: Connecting to the database

Load the necessary packages and open a connection to the Chinook database housed in the sqlite file in the data folder

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 2: Exploring the Database

**(a)** What is the average length of a track in the album with `AlbumId` = 160?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\


**(b)** Why is the following code incorrect in finding the average length of tracks for each album with `AlbumId` between 250 and 255, inclusive?

```{r, eval = F}
dbGetQuery(chinook_db,
           "SELECT AVG(Milliseconds)
           FROM track
           WHERE AlbumId >= 250 AND AlbumId <= 255")
```

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answer.**


\

**(c)** Write code to find the average length of tracks for each album with AlbumId between 250 and 255, inclusive, by using a `WHERE` clause

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(d)** Write code to find the average length of tracks for each album with `AlbumId` between 250 and 255, inclusive, by using a `HAVING` clause

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\


**(e)** Find the total number of tracks for each album with albumid between
10 and 15 inclusive. (Use an alias so the output is easy to read)

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

---

## Exercise 3: Exploring the Database

**(a)** In a single query, return the track id, track name, album id, mediatype id, and mediatype name
of all tracks with `AlbumId` = 10.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Produce the following relation with a three-way join.

| `TrackId` | `TrackName` | `AlbumId` | `AlbumTitle` | `Genre` |
|----------:|------------:|----------:|-------------:|--------:|
3178	     |        The Dundies	  |     250	 | The Office, Season 2	   |   TV Shows
3179	     |  Sexual Harassment	  |     250	 | 	The Office, Season 2	 |   TV Shows
3180	     |    Office Olympics	  |     250	 | 	The Office, Season 2	 |   TV Shows
3181	     |           The Fire	  |     250	 | 	The Office, Season 2	 |   TV Shows
3182	     |        Halloween	    |     250	 | 	The Office, Season 2	 |   TV Shows


`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(c)** Retrieve the average track size  for all tracks in each genre, along with the name of the genre. Your output will look somewhat like this:
