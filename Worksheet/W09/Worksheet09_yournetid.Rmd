# Instructions for Completion

- This worksheet consists of two parts: Computing Exercises, and Theory Exercises. 
- You must complete the computing exercises by filling in your code on this `.Rmd` file, just like you did with the previous worksheets. 
- You must complete the theory exercises on a separate sheet of paper.

\

# Computing Exercises

## Exercise 0: YAML

Update the YAML to reflect your own information (i.e. name, collaborators, etc.). If you did not collaborate with anyone, note that down in the YAML.

## Exercise 1: Flipping a Coin

Flip a fair coin three times. We are interested in the number of tails. Construct the probability mass function (pmf) for this discrete random variable...

**(a)** by hand (i.e. on a separate sheet of paper; you can use the `choose()` function in `R` to simplify your final computations a bit but the majority of your work should be done on paper).

\

**(b)** Using `R`

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(c)** Plot the pmf and cdf (cumulative distribution function).

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(d)** Using the cdf, what is the probability that you get either 1 or 2 tails? \

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 2 : Another Coin Experiment

Suppose that we toss a fair coin ten times.


**(a)** Using the `dbinom()` function, calculate the probability of obtaining between 4 and 7 heads, inclusive.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(b)** Using the `pbinom()` function, calculate the probability of obtaining between 4 and 7 heads, inclusive.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** Calculate the probability that the number of heads is greater than 6.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

## Exercise 3: Counting Defects.

A manufacturing process creates 3.4\% defective parts. A sample of 10 parts from the production process is selected, with replacement. We are interested in calculating the probability that the sample contains exactly 3 defective parts.


**(a)** Define the random variable of interest $X$.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answer.**


\

**(b)** Check that the conditions for a binomial distribution apply.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answer.**


\


**(c)** Calculate  the probability that the sample contains exactly 3 defective parts.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

# Theory Exercises

## Exercise 4: Netflix

Thirty percent of college students watch Netflix at least 3 nights a week. You randomly
select 10 college students, with replacement. What is the probability that

(a) exactly 5 of them watch Netflix at least 3 nights a week?
(b) more than 8 of them watch Netflix at least 3 nights a week, i.e. $\mathbb{P}(X > 8)$?
(c) the number of students who watch Netflix at least 3 nights a week from this sample is between 3 and 6, i.e. $\mathbb{P}(3 ≤ X ≤ 6)$?


\

## Exercise 5: Pizza Party

Suppose that 85\% of UCSB students enjoy Woodstock’s Pizza. If we collect a random sample 20 students with replacement, find the mean and standard deviation of the number of students who enjoy Woodstock’s Pizza.
