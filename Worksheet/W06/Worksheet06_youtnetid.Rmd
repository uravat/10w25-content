# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Feeling Loop-y

![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/393/656/da7.jpg)

**(a)** `repeat` loops

A [repeat loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_repeat_loop.htm) executes a statement or sequence of statements multiple times until a stop condition is met. \

**`SYNTAX:`**

```{r, eval = F}
repeat {
  statements
  if(condition) {
    break
  }
}
```

**Exercise:** Write a `repeat` loop that prints out the integers from 1 through 5, inclusive.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** `while` loops

A [while loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_while_loop.htm) repeats a statement or sequence of statements while a given condition is true. It should be noted that `R` tests the condition **before** executing the loop. \

**`SYNTAX:`**

```{r, eval = F}
while (test expression)
  {
    statement
  }
```

The `r bfcolor("break statement:", "blue")` is evaluated, and the body of the loop is entered if the result is `TRUE`. \


**Exercise (i):** Write a `while` loop to print the numbers 10 - 15. (From here on out, assume that number ranges are inclusive, unless otherwise specified.)

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**Exercise (ii):** Write a `while` loop to compute the square of numbers 1 - 8.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

---

## Exercise 2: `for` loop

Write a `for` loop that iterates over the numbers 1 through 6 and prints the cube of each number using `print()`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---


## Exercise 3: You-Cube

Write a function that returns the cube of a number. Also test your function on two different inputs.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 4: Dice-y Situation

Write a function to simulate rolling two fair, six-sided dice, returning the sum scored. Also test your function on two different inputs. **Hint:** Remember the `runif()` function.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```
