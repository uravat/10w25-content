# Instructions for Completion

- We are back to having only computing exercises on the worksheets. As such, you must complete the computing exercises by filling in your code on this `.Rmd` file.

# Exercises

## Exercise 0: YAML

Update the YAML to reflect your own information (i.e. name, collaborators, etc.). If you did not collaborate with anyone, note that down in the YAML.

# Database Introduction

In this worksheet, we will explore the "Tiny Clothes" Database that was introduced in Lecture. As a reminder, this database stores information pertaining to a (fictional) online clothing store, called "Tiny Clothes". The database is stored in the file `tinyclothes.sqlite` in the `data` folder of this worksheet; additionally, the Database Description is included in a `.PDF` file called `Database_Description.PDF`.

\

---

## Exercise 1: Exploring the Database

**(a)** Establish a connection to the database; store this connection in a variable called `tc_db`.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** List the names of all relations included in the database.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\


**(c)** What information is stored in the `INVOICES` relation? **Consult the Database Description for this part.**

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

**Replace this line with your answer.**


\

**(d)** What fields are contained in the `STOCK_TOTAL` relation? **Use Code to answer this part.**

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 2: Querying the Database

**(a)** How many employees are younger than 50? 

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(b)** Which departments begin with the letter "`S`"?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(c)** Does the "Tiny Clothes" store sell white socks?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

**(d)** An item of clothing is selected at random from the "Tiny Clothes" store. Given that this item is a pair of pants, what is the probability that it is blue? Try to do this using `SQL` queries to the greatest extent possible; you may need more than one query, and you can also feel free to perform standard mathematical operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, division, etc.) outside of your `SQL` queries.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 3: Aggregations and Averages

**(a)** What is the average quantity invoiced for orders of product `p2`?

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(b)** Using a single `SQL` Query, extract the average price of items in all orders. Return both the order number as well as the average price; use aliasing to display the average price as "`avg_price`".

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(c)** Using a suitable join, write code to join `STOCK_TOTAL` and `INVOICES` with the condition that the product numbers match.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```


\

**(d)** Produce the following table using a suitable join:

| `ORDER_NO` | `PROD_NO` | `QUANTITY` | `PRICE` | `NAME` | `COLOR` |
|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 1 | p1 | 100 | 2.99 | PANTS | BLUE |
| 1 | p2 | 20000 | 2.99 | PANTS | KHAKI |
| 2 | p2 | 1000 | 2.99 | PANTS | KHAKI |

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

## Exercise 4: New Shoes!

Due to popular demand, the 'Tiny Clothes' store has decided to start carrying shoes! In this problem, we will update the database to reflect this change.  \

**(a)** Create a new relation in the `tinyclothes` database called `SHOES`, using the following schema:

> `SHOES`(**`SHOE_ID`**, `MODEL`, `COLOR`)

**Make sure to implement PRIMARY KEYS!**

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

`r bfcolor("IMPORTANT NOTE:", "red")` You will be able to run this code chunk only once (can you tell me why?) This will prevent you from knitting your file multiple times. As such, you should set `eval` to `FALSE` after you've knitted once.


\

**(b)** Write code to check that `SHOES` now exists in your database. (Don't overthink this too much!)

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```



\

**(c)** Add the following tuples (remember that 'tuple' is another word for 'record') to SHOES:

- \<`001`, `Running`, `PINK`\>
- \<`002`, `XCountry`, `GREEN`\>

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

`r bfcolor("IMPORTANT NOTE:", "red")` Similar to the previous part, you will be able to run this code chunk only once (again, can you tell me why?) This will prevent you from knitting your file multiple times. As such, you should set `eval` to `FALSE` after you've knitted once.


\

**(d)** Try adding the tuple: \<`001`, `Climbing`, `BLUE`\>. Show that this results in an error (remember that you can change the options in your code chunk header!) and explain why you got this error.

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

\

---

## Exercise 5: Closing the Connection

Don't forget to close your connection to the database!

`r bfcolor("Solutions:", "blue")`

```{r}
# Write your code here

```
