##  Uniform  Distributions


A bus arrives at a stop every 10 minutes. A student is equally likely to arrive at the stop at any time. How long will the student have to wait?

What is the probability the waiting time, $X$, 

1. 5 minutes or less?
2. between 5 and 7 minutes?
3. more than 6 minutes?

###

- Let $X$ denote the waiting time until the next bus arrives.

- $X$ is a continuous uniform random variable, measured from 0 to 10 minutes.
- p.d.f is $f(x) = \frac{1}{10}, \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 10$

It is always helpful(and mistakes are avoided) to **draw a picture** of the density and **shade the desired area** under the curve while doing probability calculations. 

###


### Probability calculation 1: Waiting time 5 minutes or less?



```{r waitingtime1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r waitingtime1-solution}

punif(5, min = 0, max = 10)

```

### Probability calculation 2: Waiting time between 5 and 7 minutes?

```{r waitingtime2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r waitingtime2-solution}

punif(7, min = 0, max = 10) - punif(5, min = 0, max = 10)

```

### Probability calculation 3: Waiting time more than 6 minutes?

```{r waitingtime3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r waitingtime3-solution}
punif(10, min = 0, max = 10) - punif(6, min = 0, max = 10)
# or 
punif(6, min = 0, max = 10, lower.tail = FALSE)
# or
1 - punif(6, min = 0, max = 10)
```




## Generating uniform observations


### Generate a sample of size 5 from the uniform distribution on [0,10]

X âˆ¼ Unif(0, 10)

Recall: 

- punif : cdf
- dunif : density
- runif : random sample
- qunif : quantile

```{r unif4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r unif4-solution}
runif(5, min = 0, max = 10)
```

### Generate 5 samples and plot them 

```{r unif5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r unif5-solution}
hist(runif(5, min = 0, max = 10))
```

### Generate many samples and plot them 

```{r unif6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
your_code_here
```

```{r unif6-solution}
hist(runif(100, min = 0, max = 10))
```
