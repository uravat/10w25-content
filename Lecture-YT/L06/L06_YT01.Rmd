```




##  Conditionals

### Exercise 1: 

1. Run the code chunk and check that the output is correct based on the value of `x`. 
2. Change the value `x` to test the other condition. 

```{r ifelse1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- -5
if(x > 0){
print("Non-negative number")
} else {
print("Negative number")
}
```


### Exercise 2: 

**A simple conditional** 

1. Assign `x` a numerical value you choose
2. Write code that prints `x` if `x` \geq `0` otherwise it prints `-x`
3. Test this conditional by changing the value you assign to `x`
4. See what happens if you change the position of the braces to the previous/next line.
5. Alter spacing at different places in the code and see what happens. You can press `Start Over` if you need to go back to the original  
6. Remember henceforth that `R` is picky about the syntax. And remember to be nice to yourself as this is often a source of frustration for beginner programmers. 

```{r ifelse-simple, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
__add your code__
```

```{r ifelse-simple-hint-1, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
if (...) {
  x
} else { # this needs to be on one line. 
  -x
}
```

```{r ifelse-simple-solution, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
if (x >= 0) {
  x
} else { # this needs to be on one line. 
  -x
}
```

```{r ifelse-simple-test, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
if (x >= 0) {
  x
} else { # this needs to be on one line. 
  -x
}
```

### Good to know: One-line actions don't need braces!
```{r ifelse-oneline, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
if (x >= 0) x else -x
```

### nested if()

`if` can *nest* arbitrarily deeply but can get **UGLY**

### Example: 

```{r nestedif, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

x <- 10
if (x^2 < 1) {
  x^2
} else {
  if (x >= 0) {
    2*x-1
  } else {
     -2*x-1
  }
}
```

For practice, 

1. try changing the values assigned to `x` and check that you understand how control flows in this code. 
2. Given a particular output value, can you deduce what value `x` must have? Explain why or why not? 

### `ifelse()`

```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
ifelse(test expression, ifTRUE, ifFALSE)
```

1st argument is a logical test expression, then pick from the 2nd or 3rd vector arguments depending on whether logical test expression `TRUE` or `FALSE`

### **Exercise**

1. Run the following code and see what happens. Make sure you understand how it is working
2. Change the value of x so that the logical test expression is FALSE and see what happens.
3. Let `x <- 0:2`. Does the code run as expected? What would you call this `ifelse()` compared to the one in 1, above?

```{r ifelse2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- 2
ifelse(x^2 > 1, 2*abs(x)-1, x^2)
```

###  **Exercise** Vectorized `ifelse()`



1. Predict the output of the following code and see what happens by running it. Make sure you understand how it is working
2. Change the value of x or the logical test expression and verify it works as expected.


```{r ifelse3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10

ifelse(x < 5 | x > 8, x, 0)

ifelse(x < 3 | x > 9, x, "Another value")

x <- c(10:2)
ifelse( x == 5 | x > 8, "I love PSTAT 10", "MATH" )
```


## Iteration/looping: 


###  Loops in `R`

- `for` loop :  Executes a statement or sequence of statements multiple times. Tests the condition at the **end** of the loop.

- [while loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_while_loop.htm) Repeats a statement or sequence of statements while a
given condition is true. Tests the condition **before** executing the loop. 

- [repeat loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_repeat_loop.htm) Executes a statement or sequence of statements multiple
times until a stop condition is met.


### Exercise : 

Use a `for` loop to construct a table of logarithms from 1 to 10. 

```{r for-loop,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
table.of.logarithms <- vector(length=10, mode="numeric") #empty/null vector
table.of.logarithms 

for (i in 1:length(table.of.logarithms)) {
  table.of.logarithms[i] <- log(i)
}

names(table.of.logarithms) <- 1:length(table.of.logarithms)
table.of.logarithms
```

Tracing through the for loop is useful

| counter: `i` | `table.of.logarithms[i]` |
|:---:|:-------:|
| 1 | log(1) |
| 2 | log(2) |
| 3 | log(3) |
| ... | ... | 
| 10 | log(10) |

Note, there is a better way to do this job!


### Avoiding iteration: Vectorized arithmetic

**Add 2 vectors**

1. Using iteration 

```{r for-loop4,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
a <- 1:5
b <- 11:15
c <- vector(length = length(a))
for (i in 1:length(a)) {  c[i] <- a[i] + b[i]  }
c


```

2. Using vectorization 

```{r vectorize-sum,  exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
a <- 1:5
b <- 11:15
a+b
```

### Recall Modulus operator

```{r mod2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
Y <- 7
Y %% 3 # modulus operator

x <- 1:10
x %% 3
```


##  Functions in `R`
### **SYNTAX:**

```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
function_name <- function(arg1, arg2, ...)
  {
    code that does something
    return(object)
  }
```

1. **function_name:** choose a name for your function
2.  **arguments** `arg1`, `arg2`, ...
    - An argument is a placeholder
    - When a function is called or invoked, you pass a value to an argument. 
3. **function body:** Write code that does something
4.  **return** or **print**: The result

### Exercise

Write a function to convert fahrenheit to centigrade. 

Call (or invoke) the function with a fahrenheit temperature of 82. (Test the function with input 82.)


```{r function, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
fahrenheit_to_centigrade <- function( temp_F ) {
  temp_C <- ((temp_F - 32) * (5/9))
  return(temp_C)
}

fahrenheit_to_centigrade(82)
```



### Exercise:

Create a function to print squares of numbers in sequence.
Call the function supplying 6 as an argument.


```{r function2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

```

```{r function2-solution}
square_function <- function(a) {
  for(i in 1:a) {
    b <- i^2
    print(b)
  }
}

DoNotCopyPasteRunBlindly_function_InsteadThinkTypeCheckErrorsToLearnProgramming(6)
```

### What should be a function?

- Things you're going to re-run, especially if it will be re-run with changes
- Chunks of code  which are small parts of bigger analyses
- Chunks which are very similar to other chunks



## Back to some more iteration 
###

**While Loop**

**SYTAX:**

```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
while (test expression)
  {
    statement
  }
```

- `test expression` is evaluated, test expression is evaluated, and the body of the loop is entered if the result is `TRUE`.


### Exercise

1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1-3 


```{r whileloop1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

```

```{r whileloop1-solution}
i <- 1
while(i < 4) {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
}
```




### Time for some programming humor!

### `for()` vs. `while()`

`for()` is better when the number of times to repeat (values to iterate over) is
clear in advance

`while()` is better when you can recognize when to stop once you're there, even if you can't guess it to begin with

Every `for()` could be replaced with a `while()` 

<small>**Exercise:** Show this</small>

###  Repeat Loop

Executes the same code repeatedly until a stop condition is met.

**SYNTAX**

```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
repeat {
  statements
  if(condition) {
    break
  }
}
```

- \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{break statement:}} Terminates the **repeat loop** and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.



### Exercise

1. Run the code below. Describe to the person sitting next to you the logic of this code. 
2. Ask the person sitting next to you to modify the code to do something else but similar. Verify that the way they changed the code makes it work the way you want. 
3. Repeat 2. With actions reversed between the two of you. 

```{r repeat-loop, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- 1 # initialize x

repeat {
  print(x)
  x = x+1
  
  if (x == 4){
    break
  }
}
```

## More exercises

### Exercise 

Fill in the blanks so that the code counts the even numbers in a vector `x`.

```{r for-loop-2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

x <- c(6, 5, 3, 9, 8, 11, 6)
count <- 0 # initialize
for (i in ____)
  {
    if (i %% 2 == ____)
      count <- ____ + 1
  }
print(count)
```

```{r for-loop-2-solution}

x <- c(6, 5, 3, 9, 8, 11, 6)
count <- 0
for (i in x)
  {
    if (i %% 2 == 0)
      count <- count + 1
  }
print(count)
```
2. Trace through the for loop to verify the output

### Exercise 

1. How many odd numbers and how many even numbers are there in a given vector?

```{r for-loop-3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}

x <- c(6, 5, 3, 9, 8, 11, 6)
count1 <- 0 # evens
count2 <- 0 # odds
for (i in ____) {
  if(____ %% 2 == 0)
    count1 <- ____ + 1
  else count2 <- ____ + 1
}

print(paste("Number of even numbers is ", count1))
print(paste("Number of odd numbers is ", count2))
```

```{r for-loop-3-solution }

x <- c(6, 5, 3, 9, 8, 11, 6)
count1 <- 0 # evens
count2 <- 0 # odds
for (i in x) {
  if(i %% 2 == 0)
    count1 <- count1 + 1
  else count2 <- count2 + 1
}

print(paste("Number of even numbers is ", count1))
print(paste("Number of odd numbers is ", count2))
```
2. Trace through the for loop to verify the output


### Exercise:

**Given:**
```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
x <- 1
y <- 10
i <- c(1:5)
```

Write a `for` loop that increments `x` by 2 and decreases `y` by 1, for each `i`.

- `i` = 1 
    - Current Values: `x` = 1, `y` = 10 
    - New Values: `x` = 3, `y` = 9
- `i` = 2 
    - Current Values: `x` = 3, `y` = 9 
    - New Values: `x` = 5, `y` = 8
- ... and so on


```{r for-loop-4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE }
x <- 1
y <- 10
i <- c(1 : 5)

# your code here
```


```{r for-loop-4-solution }
x <- 1
y <- 10
i <- c(1 : 5)

for(j in i){
  x <- x + 2
  y <- y - 1
}

x
y
```
